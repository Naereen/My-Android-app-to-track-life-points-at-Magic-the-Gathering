# TODO / Roadmap

## "Small" improvements to the usability of the app

- [x] Maximize to full screen on mobile devices: the "window" should take all the screen space, especially on the left/right sides

- [x] Write a `manifest.json` for PWA support

- [ ] Save the state in the local storage of the browser, so that reloading the page does not reset everything

## Translating the app

- [ ] Add internationalization (i18n) support
  - [ ] English (default)
  - [ ] French (my native language)
  - [ ] Spanish
  - [ ] German
  - [ ] Italian

## Bugs fixing:

- [ ] Fix the bug where the "download / share / print" long click menu appear (on mobile devices)
- [ ] Fix a weird bug: when clicking fast on +1/-1 buttons, sometimes the life points are not updated correctly or the update continue to happen after releasing the button (worse with long clicks)

## Player status improvements

- [ ] Dead player icon
  - [ ] Allow a player to not be dead if life is below 0


## Successfully build a working apk file

- [ ] Configure the build process to generate a working apk file
- [ ] Set up deployment to GitHub Releases so that the latest apk file is always available for download
- [ ] Test it on my devices
- [ ] Publish it as a beta on the Google Play Store
